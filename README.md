# MEE7

A new moderation discord bot inspired by user dislike for a different moderation bot -- MEE6. Using a Firebase database MEE7 collected insults directed at MEE6 and used them to reply to MEE6's messages.
However, it developed more practically with moderation features such as muting, kicking, banning, and deleting messages. In addition, it uses FFMPEG functionality to edit and caption videos via user recommendation.
Built with Python, FFMPEG, discord.py, Bash Script

# Commands 
!insult <example insult>

Add your marvelous insults to my dastardly database! (anything you put after !insult will be added to a database containing all insults)

!mock

What if you want me to mock MEE6 right here, right now. MEE6 hasn't spoken but damn are you mad!

!count

See how many despicable acts of mockery I have committed against the dreaded MEE6!
